# Homelab

This repo contains my IaC homelab, which is managed with Flux and Renovate.

My goal is to run various self hosted apps I use (such as Home Assistant and
Immich) on a low power Kubernetes cluster. By following best practices, I aim
to deliver stable, fast and secure applications, while continuing to learn
about Kubernetes and GitOps.
